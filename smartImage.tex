\section{The Team}
\subsection{Matheu Botha}
\includegraphics[scale=0.02]{a}
\paragraph{Interests}
My main interests lie in Artificial Intelligence. This is applicable to the project as pattern recognition is largely considered one of the more difficult areas in computer science and some of the most progressive solutions have come from artificial intelligence algothrithms.

\paragraph{Technical Skills}
	I am proficient in the following programming languages:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item C++
		\item C#
		\item Java
		\item Javascript
		\item Python
		\item PHP
	\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Relevant Past Experience}
	In the past I have done projects with Monkey and River developing the SALGA Municipal Barometer. I have also worked with Merlynn Intelligent Technologies developing the UP2TOM app. Both of these projects involved extensive Front End development which has given me experiance with regard to developing User Interfaces, which is relevant for the project. I have also been working as a part time technical assistant for the university of pretoria which has afforded me the opportunity to work with many enterprise level development technologies in a production environmet.

\paragraph{Non-technical Strengths}
	I enjoy working as part of a team on a large project. I am also very challenge driven. I enjoying taking on challenging projects and working hard with a group of like minded individuals to overcome those challenges.

\paragraph{Motivation for Project}
	I would like to work on this project because it is a very progressive field that still has the potential for a lot of innovative work to be done in it.

\subsection{Emilio Singh}
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{Emilio}
\paragraph{Interests}
My relevant interests include the study of cryptography, video games and reading.
\paragraph{Technical Skills}
I can program using Java, C++, and a variety of scripting languages proficiently.
Furthermore, I have exposure, and somewhat fluency in Assembly.

My true strength would be in the field of mathematics and analysis however as I have shown high level competencies in various mathematical subjects while at university.
\paragraph{Relevant Past Experience}
Other than the 301 Mini Project, I have no worked on any major software system to this caliber but rest assured, I am very eager to learn and contribute towards the project.
\paragraph{Non-technical Strengths}
In terms of non-technical strengths, I would say that I have a capacity to serve in a leadership role. I have proven on numerous occasions that I can work with others and coordinate them towards a particular aim.

Furthermore, I feel that I have a level of skill with regards to communication with people from both technical and non-technical backgrounds which would typically aid in client-team communications.
\paragraph{Motivation for Project}
The Smart Image project appeals to me because I have only recently begun to explore the field of data classification and classification problems as a whole using neural networks. The idea of using image analysis or classification to help create a software system meant to help protect people is a noble one and I believe the project has merit because of this.

\section{Project Execution}
\paragraph{Developmental Methodology}
We will be following an Agile development methodology. We hope to realise this development methodology by doing the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Communicating with our clients to ensure they are informed of project progress as well as to constantly refine and update our understanding of requirements in order to meet them.
\item Construct a frequent, working software delivery schedule so that incrementally working segments of the STORM project can be delivered to our clients.
\item Commit to the delivery of simplistic, maintainable and efficient software.
\item Accept that requirements for the project may change constantly throughout the project life-cycle and develop a modular system whose functioning can be easily adapted to suit this purpose.
\item We have a strong commitment to compartmentalisation of work and will adopt pair-programming and other team-oriented development practices as we are able to.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Client-Team Communication Methods}
We will make use of the contact details provided to initiate contact so that we may establish what manner of personal, face-to-face communication we can arrange with the client to better understand the project's constraints, requirements and needs. Furthermore, we will use emails as and when necessary to request communications.

Finally, we have also created a Slack group to manage the project team for the duration of the project. The clients will be extended the offer to join the group to be more directly related to intra-team communications.
