Optimisater Solving Process

1) Construct the optimiser object based on the settings package information
2) Receive the snapshot manager reference
3) Initialise the swarm
4) Start solving process
	4.1) Check stopping conditions
			-if any are violated, we halt the process
			-otherwise we continue
	4.2) We then make a call to the solve method
		 This will take the current list of particles, and their links the former as a reference
		 It will then perform a series of updates to
		 	1) Particle positions
		 	2) Particle velocities
	4.3) After this, the new fitness values will be calculated for each particle
5) Construct the snapshot of the system as it exists
	5.1) Attempt to enqueue the snapshot into the snapshot manager
	5.2) Repeatedly attempt to enqueue the snapshot until it is able to be enqueued
6) Go back to 4)
